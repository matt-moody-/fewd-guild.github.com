# Recap

Today was our inaugural meeting, in the meeting we discussed what we want to get out of this group. Some of the ideas that came up were:

* Have lightning talks rather than presentations
* Make meetings workshops rather than presentations
* Plan hack-a-thons
* Come up with projects we could do to help make our lives better at vivint.

# Next Meeting

I will be posting some tutorials and an agenda for the beginner level FEWD members. For mid to advanced level members I will take requests for content. I will be posting something by Friday (11/28/14).

If you would like to do a lightning talk or presentation or have suggestions for the guild please [create an issue](https://github.com/FEWD-Guild/fewd-guild.github.com/issues) and tag it appropriately.

### FEWD 4 LIFE!
