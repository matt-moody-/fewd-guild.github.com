## Agenda

3:30 - Split up and work on Projects  
3:55 - Final announcements  
4:00 - Continue working / hangout

## Lightening Talks
The idea of lightning talks is to give several people the chance to spend 5 to 15 minutes talking about something they want to share. Examples of lightning talk topics:

* I'm working on this 
* I love this 
* I want to know more about this 
* What do you guys think about this? 
* I need some help and advice
